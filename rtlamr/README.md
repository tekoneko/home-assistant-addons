# RTLAMR to MQTT Bridge hass.io addon
Add-on for software defined radio tuned to listen for 433MHz RF transmissions and republish the data via MQTT

This addon is based on the addon from jdeath here: https://github.com/jdeath/RTLAMR2MQQT
which is based on biochemguy's (non-docker) setup: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/get-your-smart-electric-water-and-gas-meter-scm-readings-into-home-assistant-with-a-rtl-sdr
which in turn is based on James Fry' project here: https://github.com/james-fry/hassio-addons/tree/master/rtl4332mqtt
which was based on Chris Kacerguis' project here: https://github.com/chriskacerguis/honeywell2mqtt,
which is in turn based on Marco Verleun's rtl2mqtt image here: https://github.com/roflmao/rtl2mqtt
